# 🚀 SendGrid Setup Guide - Step by Step

## ✅ What's Already Done

I've already:
- ✅ Installed `@sendgrid/mail` package
- ✅ Updated `emailService.js` to support both SendGrid and Gmail
- ✅ Added automatic fallback to Gmail if SendGrid is not configured
- ✅ Enhanced logging to show which provider is being used

## 📋 What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Create SendGrid Account (2 minutes)

1. Go to: **https://signup.sendgrid.com/**
2. Click **"Start for Free"**
3. Fill in your details:
   - Email: Your email address
   - Password: Create a strong password
   - Click **"Create Account"**
4. **Verify your email** (check your inbox)
5. Complete the onboarding questions:
   - Role: Developer
   - Company: Ayanna Kiyanna Sinhala Institute
   - Purpose: Transactional emails
   - Number of emails: 0-100 per day

### Step 2: Get SendGrid API Key (1 minute)

1. After logging in, go to: **https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys**
   
   Or navigate: **Settings** → **API Keys** (left sidebar)

2. Click **"Create API Key"** button (top right)

3. Fill in the details:
   - **API Key Name:** `Ayanna-Kiyanna-Backend-Production`
   - **API Key Permissions:** Select **"Full Access"**
   
4. Click **"Create & View"**

5. **IMPORTANT:** Copy the API key NOW!
   ```
   SG.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   ```
   - You'll only see it once
   - Save it in a secure place (you'll need it for Render)

6. Click **"Done"**

---

### Step 3: Verify Sender Email (3 minutes)

**IMPORTANT:** SendGrid requires you to verify the email address you'll send from.

1. Go to: **https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/sender_auth/senders**
   
   Or navigate: **Settings** → **Sender Authentication** → **Verify a Single Sender**

2. Click **"Create New Sender"** or **"Verify a Single Sender"**

3. Fill in the form:
   ```
   From Name: Ayanna Kiyanna Sinhala Institute
   From Email Address: ayannakiyannanotify@gmail.com
   Reply To: ayannakiyannanotify@gmail.com
   Company Address: [Your institute's address]
   City: [Your city]
   Country: Sri Lanka
   Nickname: Ayanna Kiyanna Main
   ```

4. Click **"Save"**

5. **Check your email** (ayannakiyannanotify@gmail.com)
   - You'll receive a verification email from SendGrid
   - Click the **"Verify Single Sender"** button in the email

6. You should see: ✅ **"Sender verified successfully"**

---

### Step 4: Update Render Environment Variables (2 minutes)

1. Go to: **https://dashboard.render.com/**

2. Click on your **backend service** (ayanna-kiyanna-backend or similar)

3. Click **"Environment"** in the left sidebar

4. Add these **3 new environment variables:**

   ```
   SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.your-api-key-here-paste-the-full-key
   SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=ayannakiyannanotify@gmail.com
   SENDGRID_FROM_NAME=Ayanna Kiyanna Sinhala Institute
   ```

   **How to add:**
   - Click **"Add Environment Variable"**
   - Key: `SENDGRID_API_KEY`
   - Value: Paste your full API key (starts with `SG.`)
   - Click **"Add"**
   - Repeat for the other two variables

5. **Optional:** You can keep the Gmail variables as backup:
   ```
   EMAIL_USER=ayannakiyannanotify@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASS=your-gmail-app-password
   ```
   (The system will use SendGrid first, Gmail as fallback)

6. Click **"Save Changes"**

7. Render will automatically **redeploy** your service (takes 2-3 minutes)

---

### Step 5: Verify It's Working (2 minutes)

1. **Wait for Render to finish deploying** (watch the logs)

2. Go to: **Render Dashboard** → **Your Service** → **Logs**

3. Look for these success messages:
   ```
   ✅ SendGrid email service initialized
   📧 Using SendGrid with email: ayannakiyannanotify@gmail.com
   📤 From name: Ayanna Kiyanna Sinhala Institute
   🎯 Email provider: SendGrid (Production-ready)
   ```

4. **Test user registration:**
   - Go to your website
   - Try to register a new user
   - Enter an email address you can access

5. **Check the logs again:**
   ```
   📧 Attempting to send OTP email to: user@example.com
   🎯 Using provider: SendGrid
   📤 Sending email via SendGrid (attempt 1/3)...
   ✅ OTP email sent successfully via SendGrid
   Response status: 202
   ```

6. **Check your email inbox** - You should receive the OTP email!

---

## 🎯 How It Works Now

Your email service is now **hybrid** and **smart**:

1. **If `SENDGRID_API_KEY` is set:** Uses SendGrid (recommended for production)
2. **If `SENDGRID_API_KEY` is NOT set:** Falls back to Gmail SMTP
3. **Automatic retry:** 3 attempts with exponential backoff
4. **Detailed logging:** Shows which provider is being used

**Solution:** You forgot to verify the sender email in Step 3
- Go back to Step 3 and verify your sender email
- Check your email inbox for the verification link

**Solution:** Wrong API key
- Double-check you copied the full API key (starts with `SG.`)
- Make sure there are no extra spaces
- Generate a new API key if needed

### Error: "API key does not have permission"

**Solution:** API key doesn't have full access
- Go to SendGrid → Settings → API Keys
- Delete the old key
- Create a new one with **"Full Access"** permissions

### Emails not arriving

**Solution:** Check SendGrid activity
- Go to: https://app.sendgrid.com/email_activity
