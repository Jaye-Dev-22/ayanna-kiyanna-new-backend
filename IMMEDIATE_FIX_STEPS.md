# 🚨 IMMEDIATE FIX - Email Connection Timeout

## What I've Done ✅

I've already updated your email service code with:
- ✅ Better timeout handling (10s connection, 30s socket timeout)
- ✅ Retry logic (3 attempts with exponential backoff)
- ✅ Connection pooling for better performance
- ✅ Enhanced error logging for easier debugging
- ✅ TLS configuration optimized for Gmail

## What You Need to Do NOW 👇

### Option 1: Fix Gmail SMTP (5 minutes)

**Step 1: Generate New Gmail App Password**

1. Open: https://myaccount.google.com/security
2. Make sure **"2-Step Verification"** is **ON**
3. Open: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
4. Create new app password:
   - App: **Mail**
   - Device: **Other (Custom name)** → Type: "Render Backend"
5. Click **Generate**
6. Copy the 16-character password (looks like: `xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx`)
7. **IMPORTANT:** Remove all spaces → Final: `xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`

**Step 2: Update Render Environment Variables**

1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com/
2. Click on your backend service
3. Click **"Environment"** in the left sidebar
4. Add/Update these variables:

```
EMAIL_USER=ayannakiyannanotify@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=paste-your-16-char-password-here-no-spaces
```

5. Click **"Save Changes"**
6. Wait 2-3 minutes for automatic redeploy

**Step 3: Verify It Works**

1. Go to Render → Your Service → **Logs**
2. Look for:
   ```
   ✅ Email service is ready and connected
   📧 Using email: ayannakiyannanotify@gmail.com
   ```
3. Try registering a new user on your website
4. Check logs for:
   ```
   📧 Attempting to send OTP email to: user@example.com
   📤 Sending email (attempt 1/3)...
   ✅ OTP email sent successfully
   ```

### Option 2: Switch to SendGrid (15 minutes - RECOMMENDED)

If Gmail keeps failing, use SendGrid (it's FREE and more reliable):

**Step 1: Create SendGrid Account**
1. Go to: https://signup.sendgrid.com/
2. Sign up (it's free - 100 emails/day)
3. Verify your email

**Step 2: Get API Key**
1. Go to: https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys
2. Click **"Create API Key"**
3. Name: "Ayanna Kiyanna Backend"
4. Permissions: **"Full Access"**
5. Click **"Create & View"**
6. **COPY THE KEY** (you'll only see it once!)

**Step 3: Verify Sender**
1. Go to: https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/sender_auth/senders
2. Click **"Create New Sender"**
3. Fill in:
   - From Name: `Ayanna Kiyanna Sinhala Institute`
   - From Email: `ayannakiyannanotify@gmail.com`
   - Reply To: Same
   - Address: Your institute address
4. Click **"Save"**
5. **Check your email** and verify the sender

**Step 4: Install SendGrid Package**

On your local machine:
```bash
cd ayanna-kiyanna-new-backend
npm install @sendgrid/mail
git add .
git commit -m "Add SendGrid email service"
git push
```

**Step 5: Update Render Environment Variables**

Add these to Render:
```
SENDGRID_API_KEY=paste-your-api-key-here
SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=ayannakiyannanotify@gmail.com
SENDGRID_FROM_NAME=Ayanna Kiyanna Sinhala Institute
```

**Step 6: Replace Email Service File**

I've created a SendGrid version for you at:
`ayanna-kiyanna-new-backend/services/emailService.sendgrid.js`

To use it:
```bash
cd ayanna-kiyanna-new-backend/services
mv emailService.js emailService.gmail.backup.js
mv emailService.sendgrid.js emailService.js
```

Then copy all the email template methods from the backup file to the new file.

## 🧪 Test Locally First (Optional)

Before deploying, test your email config locally:

```bash
cd ayanna-kiyanna-new-backend
node test-email.js
```

Follow the prompts to test if your Gmail credentials work.
