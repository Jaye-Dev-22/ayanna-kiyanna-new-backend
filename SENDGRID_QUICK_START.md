## ✅ Success Indicators

**In Render Logs:**

🎯 Email provider: SendGrid (Production-ready)

📧 Attempting to send OTP email to: user@example.com

## 🔧 Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "From email does not match verified sender" | Go back to Step 3, verify sender email |
| "Unauthorized" | Check API key is correct, starts with `SG.` |
| Logs show "Gmail SMTP" instead of "SendGrid" | Check `SENDGRID_API_KEY` is set in Render |
| Email not arriving | Check spam folder, verify sender in SendGrid |

## 📊 Monitor Emails

After setup, monitor your emails at:
https://app.sendgrid.com/email_activity

You'll see:
- ✅ Delivered emails
- 📧 Open rates
- ❌ Bounces
- 📊 Statistics

## 🎯 Environment Variables Summary

**Required for SendGrid:**
```bash
SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=ayannakiyannanotify@gmail.com

```

**Optional (Gmail fallback):**
